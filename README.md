## 📈 Easily Monitor Investment Performance Across All Accounts

### 🤔 The Problem 

Tracking how well your investments, savings, or pension pots perform each year can be **extremely complicated**. Why? Because during any given year, you’re likely to make multiple deposits into (or withdrawals from) your accounts. These transactions make it hard to determine the **actual percentage return** ('Internal Rate of Return' or 'XIRR' in finance-speak) on your investments.  

For example, when assessing how well your pension provider is doing for you, regular contributions into your pension make it challenging to see the wood from the trees. Maybe your pension grew last year from £10,000 to £15,000 but you made deposits into your pension during the year worth £7,000. You can imagine how someone might mistakenly think their pension provider is performing well because they are making regular payments into it! 

To calculate your **actual percentage return** (a.k.a. **XIRR**), you don't need to learn anything about all the complex things your pension is invested in. 

You just need **three** things:  

1. **📅 Starting Balance**: Your account balance on **1st January**.  
2. **📅 Ending Balance**: Your account balance on **31st December**.  
3. **💵 Transactions**: A record of all **deposits and withdrawals**, including their **values** and **dates**.
